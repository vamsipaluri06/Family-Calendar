## 🔥 Enable Cloud Sync (Optional)

To sync data across devices:

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Create a new project (it's free!)
3. Enable **Realtime Database** (Build → Realtime Database → Create Database)
4. Set database rules to allow read/write for testing:
   ```json
   {
     "rules": {
       ".read": true,
       ".write": true
     }
   }
   ```
5. Go to Project Settings → Your Apps → Add Web App
6. Copy the config values
7. Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```
   VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
   VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
   VITE_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=https://your-project-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com
   VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
   VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.appspot.com
   VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=123456789
   VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:123456789:web:abc123
   ```
8. Restart the dev server

**Without Firebase**, the app uses localStorage (single device only).
